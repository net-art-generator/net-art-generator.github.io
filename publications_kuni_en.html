		generator. latin root, generatus. god as generator of the world and god as creator of human beings. the analogy of the deus artifex corresponds to that of the artist creating his works like a god, an image that has returned again and again since
		the renaissance. to briefly outline this function would mean saying that the makeup of the autonomous individual as the apotheosis of the human being is justified up to the point at which such individuals, as homo creator, as an artist approaches
		the position of a god. in both forms, the original act of creation is bound to its inevitable consequence, the transformation into a serial product. But serial processes are a distinguishing characteristic of the modern.
		<br /><br />
		artists usually buy a mac when they want to work digitally. it can be counted as a loss if the resistant material on which artistic efforts are focused dissipates in on-screen images. but net.art only works on the net and chooses the net or the
		myth of the net as its theme. the idea is fundamental, although at the same time, doubtful without a medium-specific translation and without the participation of others. but when the event of its form of reproduction becomes more important
		socially than it is in its original form, then the original must be made with consideration for its reproduction. nevertheless, all net.art projects may be traced back to a single origin, or in other words: to an author. the stagnation of the
		world in ongoing repetition of the same is the guarantee of immortality for its initial motivator. what would be left of the idea based on an individual artist when it comes to the collaboration of many remains unforeseeable.
		<br /><br />
		the essay you just have read is probably completely meaningless and was randomly generated by a text generatrix. to generate a piece of net.art follow this link: <a href="http://net.art-generator.com"

		<br /><br />
		Well. The recommendation holds. The text that precedes it, though, may seem not to offer much in the way of meaning at first glance - which can be a bit irritating when one considers that more than the surreal poetry of meaningless chains of
		syllables or words can now be expected of cleverly programmed generators: Namely, veritable net.art of timeless truth, beauty and good.
		<br /><br />
		So did it perhaps have something to do with the original material? Hopefully not: Because the ode to the net.art.generator was indeed only half-automatically generated – on the one hand, from texts aiming seriously and with a notable effort
		towards meaning to address the topic of authorship and the genius of the artist, and on the other hand, from similar texts addressing art on the net. All these texts, taken on their own, make coherent arguments – whether or not one shares their
		viewpoints. The loss of this clarity, even though central arguments have been quoted, is due less to blind arbitrariness than to the intent of pointing to problems of compatibility of a fundamental nature via data compression; problems which, due
		to the structures of art operating system and their historical roots, arise when programs are supposed to run on them that are invested with certain utopias of net culture in general – and especially those that aim to see here a completely new
		art form bloom within in which, instead of a self-enclosed art work legitimized by the signature of the artist as his brilliant creation, suddenly a sort of digital "social sculpture". Immaterial and, as with all that is spiritual or intellectual
		in art, bordering on the transcendental – but part of pop culture nonetheless; "interactive", of course (that's very important), open and accessible - but in no way trivial. Endlessly reproducible – but please, not only original as well, but
		also, somehow, an original. Immediately understood as ingenious. Only: If everyone is to be a net.artist, how does one sell oneself as a unique artist?
		<br /><br />
		In short: The little text was the result of a collision of swirling streams of data that had already been generated by others. Brought and set together by a generator who in this case was not creating net.art, but rather, a contribution to a
		catalogue on the net.art.generator by the artist Cornelia Sollfrank. *1 Whether the rules of art by which such monographic appreciations tend to be written have been broken can be set aside for the moment. Cryptic chains of words looking
		suspiciously like they bear theoretical depth while nodding to a few impactful key terms are actually part and parcel of most respectable monographs. All that's clearly missing from this text are the obligatory acknowledgements of the life and
		works of the artist. That absence might be attributed to the theme and means of functioning of the work which ultimately just as elegantly as clearly leads the answer to the question of the authorship of the artist to those called upon to be
		co-creators and then to program of the net.art.generator as it is set in motion. But only to have it implicitly lead back to the initiator of the entire process: "A smart artist makes the machine do the work". In view of this motto, which has
		long been the text in Sollfrank's email signature file - even if one includes in the calculations the participating programmers *2 called upon and directed by the generator of the generator -in the end, the primacy of the "idea", the concept,
		remains. And the artist's signature.
		<br /><br />
		What this movement means can be better understood when one examines the context in which its carried out a bit more closely: The area of tension in which the debates concerning the previously mentioned problems of compatibility between the
		utopias of net culture and the realities of the "art operating system", debates which have shaped reception of the phenomenon of net.art for some time - and on the producing end as well as the reception end. A field, then, which has proven itself
		to be, at times more, at times less a "smart net.art.history.generator". There is no space here to approach this context even closer,and so, at this point, one can only refer briefly to texts that would lead further. *3 But that might be just
		fine. After all, this book should accomplish what a "respectable monograph" of the old school aims to: Namely, to be a "(net.)art.history.generator". The focus is on the artist and her work, and the context in this case can be frames within
		frames. One would have to leave a continuation and expansion of this "framing" to following publications. And - one assumes - to Sollfrank herself.
